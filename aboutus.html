		<p>Air Travel India is a leading global online travel company that uses innovative technology to enable leisure and business travelers to search for, plan and book a broad range of travel products and services including airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and vacation packages.

		<p>Air Ticket India was originally formed by a group of leading indian airlines in 1999 to participate in the rapidly growing online travel industry. The airline investors in Air Ticket India consisted of Indian Airlines, Kingfisher Airlines, Air India, Spice Jet Airlines and United Air Lines. The Air Ticket India website was launched in 2001. In November 2004, Air Ticket India was acquired by Cendant and assumed responsibility for Cendant's domestic online travel business, which included CheapTickets, a leading online travel brand focused on the value-conscious traveler, and for Flairview Travel, which operated the international online hotel websites HotelClub.com and RatesToGo.com. In February 2005, Cendant acquired ebookers, a leading international online travel brand with an online presence in 13 countries in Asia. Air Ticket India Worldwide was formed through the combination of Air Ticket India and the online travel assets of Cendant's travel distribution services division and became a public company in July 2007.</p>
